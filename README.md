# CEF 2017 Workshop

Code and teaching material for "Modeling with Julia -- with an Application to the New York Fed DSGE", a workshop at [CEF 2017](http://comp-econ.org/CEF_2017/index.htm).

## Software

We assume that participants will have access to

* [Julia](http://julialang.org/)
* [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) and [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)
* [DSGE](https://github.com/FRBNY-DSGE/DSGE.jl)

For those using their own machines, it's possible install all of this (except DSGE.jl) and more in one go by installing

* [JuliaPro](http://juliacomputing.com/products/juliapro.html)

Make sure that you have the latest version, which is currently JuliaPro
0.5.1.  A free version is now available.
